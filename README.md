# Alnk - Under Maintenance :construction:
Alnk is a URL shortener designed with lightweightness, user and sysadmin-friendliness, privacy, and configurability in mind. This web application will be developed using the following technologies:
<ul>
  <li>Django (Back-end)</li>
  <li>Django Rest Framework (API)</li>
  <li>Redis (Data storage)</li>
  <li>React (Front-end)</li>
</ul>

The API will be deployed using gunicorn and nginx along with caching capabilities to make it super-fast. At the end we will use docker to easily containerize our application.

More information will be included...
